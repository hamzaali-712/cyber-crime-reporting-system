## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Supabase account
- Groq API key
- Optional local ClamAV for malware scanning (not required on Streamlit Cloud)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cyber-crime-reporting-system
   ```

2. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and database URLs
   ```

5. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new project
   - Run database migrations from `database/migrations/`
   - Configure storage buckets

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   streamlit run frontend/app.py

   # Backend (if separate)
   uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload
   ```

> Note: The Streamlit app entrypoint is `frontend/app.py`. This is the correct file path for local development and Streamlit Cloud deployment.
